# Note-Taker

## Description

This is a note taking application that will allow you to, you guessed it, write and save notes. There's a landing page with a link that will take you to the notes page. When you enter a new note title a save icon pops up in the navigation bar to save your note once it's typed up. 

When you save a note it will show up under the note tutle on the left sidebar. If you want to view it again just click it. You can use the plus icon to get new empty field to write your note in. Once you are done with a note and wish to remove it you can click the trashcan and delete the note.
